        Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs personality 
        test. According to the Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types. 
        Our template integrates questions from this online personality test example into a series of 
        sliding bar graphics. If you’re confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the 
        Myers Briggs basics article.

        I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m working on 
        (and find the parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so I can 
        convey things responsively. Most of the time perfection isn’t an issue and 
        the sketches are just for me.

        I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you 
        in to each screen. For each of those screens I added a floating footer 
        that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow and jump 
        around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe.
